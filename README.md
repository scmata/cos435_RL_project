# cos435_RL_project

This is an implementation of MR Q by Finlay Jordan, Sean Mata, Xun Hu. 
It includes an implementation of the main MR Q algorithm alongside two strategies for improving MR Q since the original algorithm is determinstic. These two startegies are entropy regularisation and bootstrapping.


IMPORTANT: for the most latest branch that includes proper referencing, view the "bootstrapping" branch.

We used some references when constructing this code.
This includes the TD3 implementation Sean wrote for Homework 6 which included skeleton code from the COS435 supervisors. These have been cited as "Referenced from Homework 6"

The main task of this project is reimplementing the MR Q algorithm created by Fujimoto et al. 2025 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/MRQ). We write our own version of the main algorithm including the instantiation of all neural networks. We use the original replay buffer and other small miscellaneous functions.
